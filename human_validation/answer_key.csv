1,chen_06_t2,Mem0,contradiction_update,incorrect,"The system's answer stating that currently supporting 20 languages is outdated, as the ground truth indicates the version uses 50 languages and 16 experts."
2,maria_07_t1,LangMem,implicit_preference,correct,"The system correctly identified that Maria prefers tiny examples for learning, aligning with the ground truth that she favors short, focused code examples and one concept at a time."
3,david_08_t2,Agent-Driven,temporal_relevance,correct,"The system's answer is factually correct as it acknowledges that it does not have updated information about the user's on-call schedule for this week. The ground truth mentioned that the user's on-call was specific to a past week, and the system effectively communicates the lack of current data on this matter."
4,maria_07_t2,LangMem,simple_recall,correct,"The system retrieved relevant memories about Maria's new job and confirmed the tech stack of TypeScript, Tailwind, and Next.js. The answer is accurate and up-to-date with the ground truth."
5,amara_19_t3,Agent-Driven,implicit_preference,correct,"The system accurately retrieved and stated the user's preference for step-by-step details, aligning with the ground truth answer."
6,david_08_t1,Mem0,contradiction_update,incorrect,"The system provided the outdated role of Senior DevOps Engineer instead of the current role as Staff Engineer, which indicates that it used stale information."
7,sophie_15_t1,Mem0,cross_session,partially_correct,"The system retrieved relevant information about the engagement dashboard and the need to ship API v1 by the end of Q2. However, it missed key details regarding the shift to custom analytics for the district client and the beta status of the district module. Additionally, some irrelevant context about drafting user stories distracts from the core answer."
8,hannah_17_t2,LangMem,implicit_preference,correct,"The system's answer accurately reflects that Hannah prefers action items to be presented in numbered lists, aligning with the ground truth and using up-to-date information."
9,raj_16_t3,Agent-Driven,simple_recall,partially_correct,"The answer mentions a telemedicine video call feature that is being planned but misses the key detail of appointment booking, which is also a main feature of the app as per the ground truth."
10,lily_13_t3,LangMem,temporal_relevance,correct,"The system retrieved the current information that Lily has completed her role as a TA for CS224N this quarter, which matches the ground truth answer accurately."
11,yuki_09_t4,LangMem,implicit_preference,incorrect,The system's answer does not address any of the specific design decisions or feedback from playtesters that drive Yuki's game design. Key information regarding the switch from turn-based to real-time combat and the focus on PC over Switch is missing.
12,raj_16_t3,LangMem,simple_recall,correct,"The system's answer accurately reflects the main features of the app, including appointment booking, medication reminders, and the addition of the video calling feature, which aligns with the ground truth and utilizes the most up-to-date information."
13,elena_11_t5,Agent-Driven,noise_resistance,correct,"The system correctly recalled that the user's office coffee machine broke, which aligns with the user's stress. The information is up-to-date and relevant to the question asked."
14,sarah_01_t1,Mem0,contradiction_update,correct,The system retrieved the right memories and provided an answer consistent with the ground truth that you switched to Neovim as your editor. The information is up-to-date and accurate.
15,amara_19_t2,Mem0,consolidation,partially_correct,"The system provided some correct information (initial mAP of 89.3% and 91.1% with faster iteration cycle), but it failed to mention the current performance of 93.5% after architecture changes, which is a key detail."
16,maria_07_t1,Mem0,implicit_preference,correct,"The system's answer aligns with the ground truth by emphasizing the preference for small, focused examples, which is consistent with the retrieved memories and does not contain outdated information."
17,yuki_09_t1,Agent-Driven,contradiction_update,correct,"The system retrieved the relevant information about the game's combat style correctly, confirming that 'Starbound Chronicles' features real-time combat with a pause feature based on playtester feedback, which aligns with the ground truth answer."
18,aisha_05_t3,LangMem,noise_resistance,correct,"The system correctly stated that it does not have information about flight delays and that its memories focus on HealthPulse-related details, which aligns with the ground truth answer."
19,david_08_t4,Agent-Driven,implicit_preference,partially_correct,"While the answer correctly identifies the user's focus on cost reduction and mentions the cost target and tracking, it lacks specific details about the focus on right-sizing with VPA and switching to VPC endpoints to further reduce costs, which were part of the required memories."
20,hannah_17_t1,Mem0,temporal_relevance,correct,The system's answer is factually correct as it confirms the IRB amendment was approved. It retrieved the appropriate and current memory regarding the IRB amendment status.
21,lily_13_t3,Agent-Driven,temporal_relevance,correct,"The system's answer is factually correct and reflects the current status of the user's TA responsibilities, aligning with the ground truth that the user finished TAing and is now focused on research."
22,alex_10_t2,LangMem,cross_session,correct,"The system correctly summarized Alex's body of work on the AI environmental impact topic, accurately reflecting the published Verge article, the follow-up on tropical climate data centers, and the commissioned piece for The Atlantic on AI chip manufacturing. All retrieved memories were accurate and up-to-date."
23,amara_19_t2,LangMem,consolidation,incorrect,"The system did not retrieve the key performance metrics related to the model's evolution over time, specifically the mAP improvements, which are critical for answering the test question. Instead, it focused on unrelated information about inference time and GPU usage."
24,priya_03_t3,Mem0,cross_session,partially_correct,"The system captured the aspects of being a total beginner and the need to learn SQL, but it failed to include key details such as the learning of pandas, plotly, the success of the board meeting dashboard, and the current project of building an internal metrics tool."
25,diego_18_t3,LangMem,noise_resistance,correct,"The system's answer is factually correct as it accurately states that there are no memories retrieved about empanadas, aligning with the ground truth. Additionally, the system did not retrieve irrelevant memories, and all information is up to date."
26,james_04_t2,Agent-Driven,consolidation,correct,"The system correctly retrieved the right memories, provided a factually accurate answer based on the ground truth, and used the most up-to-date information regarding the model results across languages."
27,priya_03_t4,Agent-Driven,temporal_relevance,incorrect,"The system's answer is incorrect because it states the board meeting is scheduled for February 15th, but the ground truth indicates that the board meeting already happened. This represents a stale memory issue as it failed to acknowledge the completed status of the meeting."
